In the main program we need some loop over all walkers
until all walkers are killed.

While at least one walker alive, do:

	1.Search through the list of process ending times.
	  	Find the process that is finishing next
	2.End this process:
		2.1 Write ending time to history
		2.2 Release resources of the walker
	3.Proceed with this walker to the next Block
		3.1 If the next Block is a merging AND (or something like that),
		    allocate the respective resources, indicating the presence of a walker. (To be discussed in more detail)
		3.2 Set the process to status "queued", even though it could possibly run.
		    We need to queue the walker since otherwise it could overtake
		    other walkers, which doesn't make much sense.
	4.For all elements in the queue and until nothing can run anymore:
		4.1 Check if the walker can run/proceed
		4.2 Allocate resources, and potentially run it, set ending time
