## Quick compile guide

### Requirements
So far, just standard libraries and `qmake`. You can install it in this way:

+ **Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install qt5-qmake`
+ **MacOS:** `brew install qt5` (unfortunately, no `qmake`-only solution)

### Compiling procedure
Just run

```
qmake && make
./SimulationEngine
```

and you should see some Hello World stuff.
